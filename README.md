# falcon

Uses WebGL and JavaScript to completely build and animate 3D clip of an object dynamically moving at a real-time frame rate.
All coloring and texturing implemented robustly to reflect light dynamically.
Designed a two-level hierarchical object for the landing gear for the spaceship, which is a set of retracting arms and folding landing pads. 
Also built and texturized a custom reflective polygon, spaceship, planets, and background used to represent space.
