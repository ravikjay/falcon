An animation of the Millenium Falcon taking off from the Death Star and warping to light speed! 

Uses WebGL and JavaScript to completely build and animate 3D clip of an object dynamically moving at a real-time frame rate.
All coloring and texturing implemented robustly to reflect light dynamically.
Designed a two-level hierarchical object for the landing gear for the spaceship, which is a set of retracting arms and folding landing pads. 
Also built and texturized a custom reflective polygon, spaceship, planets, and background used to represent space.

## Live Demo
